(I'm writing this\\nfrom memory; I've lost the reference. Please correct me if I'm wrong.)\\n\\nUsing the board, I've had problems with file icons being lost, but it's\\nhard to say whether it's the board's fault or something else; however,\\nif I decompress the troubled file and recompress it without the board,\\nthe icon usually reappears. Because of the above mentioned licensing\\nproblem, the freeware expansion utility DD Expand will not decompress\\na board-compressed file unless you have the board installed.\\n\\nSince Stac has its own product now, it seems unlikely that the holes\\nin Autodoubler/Diskdoubler related to the board will be fixed.\\nWhich is sad, and makes me very reluctant to buy Stac's product since\\nthey're being so stinky.
